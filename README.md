# Setup Local Environment (Mac)

0. Prerequisites:

  Ensure you have the following prerequisites before trying to run the project locally:
  - Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Alternatively, check if you have this by using command ```node -v```
  - Once you have Node.js and npm, run command ```npm install -g expo-cli```
  - You will need an iOS simulator. If you have a Macbook, its recommended you install XCode from the app store as it has a built in iOS simulator. If you have a Windows machine, unfortunately you will have to install a virtual machine to run the iOS simulator.

2. Clone this repository using ```git clone https://github.com/uoftblueprint/the-period-purse.git```
3. cd into folder tpp-app ```cd ./tpp-app```
4. run ```npm install```
5. cd into folder ios ```cd ./ios```
6. Install pods ```pod install```
7. cd back out to tpp-app folder ```cd ..```
8. Run the project using ```npm run ios```
9. The simulator should open automatically and you should see something like the following image, with the Menstruation Nation app on the home screen:

## Windows
Menstruation Nation does not support development on Windows. You may choose to create a virtual machine with a tutorial like this: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q55e2Tz-818)

## Linux
Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c30RLycIpVY)
